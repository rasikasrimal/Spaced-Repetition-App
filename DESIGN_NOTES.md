# Design Notes

## Dashboard layout rationale

- **Progress visibility** – Moving the Progress today module directly beneath the daily summary cards keeps completion feedback front-and-centre so learners see motivation cues before filtering topics.
- **Section separators** – Introducing subtle divider rules above and below the progress card creates distinct modules without heavy shadows, making the dashboard easier to scan in light and dark themes.
- **Typography alignment** – Matching the Progress today heading scale with other section titles preserves rhythm across the page and reinforces the hierarchy of supporting body text.
- **Accent usage** – Highlighting completion percentages and motivation copy with the success palette ties the card back to other positive states (e.g., streak and completion chips) while maintaining required contrast.
