**Context:**  
Lays the groundwork mirroring the web app's overall architecture and shared utilities.

**Prompt for Codex to Use:**  
"Create a new Flutter project named `spaced_repetition_app`, configure `/lib/features/` subdirectories for today, dashboard, timeline, subjects, explore, shared widgets, state, and services. Set up Material 3 themes supporting dark and light modes, define global color constants aligned with the web palette, and initialize route scaffolding placeholders for each feature. Include dependency setup for Riverpod, GoRouter, Hive, hive_flutter, fl_chart, and flutter_local_notifications in `pubspec.yaml`, ensuring offline-first readiness."

**Dependencies:**  
None.

**Output Type:**  
Architecture spec + project scaffolding code.

### Prompt 2: Implement Navigation Bar & Routing

Mirrors the Today | Dashboard | Timeline | Subjects | Explore tabs with animated transitions.

**Prompt for Codex to Use:**  
"Implement a `MainShell` widget using `GoRouter` with five routes (`/today`, `/dashboard`, `/timeline`, `/subjects`, `/explore`) and a Material 3 bottom navigation bar reflecting the web labels. Provide animated slide-fade transitions between tabs, persistence of navigation state, and accessibility labels for each destination. Ensure the scaffold supports future profile modal actions and integrates with Riverpod navigation state providers."

**Context:**  
Equivalent to the web `/today` route's review queue and difficulty adjustments.

**Prompt for Codex to Use:**  
"Build a Flutter `TodayPage` widget that fetches up to 5 due topics from the local Hive database via Riverpod providers, displaying cards with topic name, subject badge, retention percentage, difficulty, and action buttons. Implement revise and skip buttons with animations, and show a bottom sheet asking `EASY / NORMAL / HARD` to adjust the spaced repetition schedule (calling the algorithm service). Include a `Load More` action to fetch the next batch of 5 topics and maintain state persistence across navigations."

**Goal:**  
Translate the adaptive review scheduling logic into Flutter services.

**Context:**  
Mirrors the web app's forgetting curve-based review scheduler.

**Prompt for Codex to Use:**  
"Develop a `SpacedRepetitionService` in Dart that models the forgetting curve with adjustable decay constants. Allow configuration of user retention thresholds, reset retention to 100% after reviews, and extend intervals based on EASY/NORMAL/HARD responses. Provide methods to compute next review date, update topic retention, and emit analytics data for charts. Ensure test coverage with unit tests verifying scheduling accuracy."
