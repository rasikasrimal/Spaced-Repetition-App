# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We aim to keep the `main` branch secure with timely dependency updates and security patches. Please use the latest tagged release or the current `main` branch for the most up-to-date fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email `rasikasrimal.contact@gmail.com` with the details. Include:

- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any suggested remediation or patches.

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and work with you to assess the report. Once the fix is ready, we will coordinate disclosure and credit you (if desired).

## Disclosure Policy

- Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before we have had a reasonable chance to release a fix.
- We prioritise security issues over feature work and will provide status updates until the issue is resolved.

Thank you for helping keep the Spaced Repetition App secure!
