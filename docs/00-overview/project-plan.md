# Project Plan

## Phases
1. **Discovery and alignment**
   - Review charter, roadmap, and existing user feedback.
   - Audit current documentation, UI, and test coverage.
   - Finalise release targets and prioritised backlog.
2. **Design and specification**
   - Update architecture diagrams and data model notes to reflect the latest features.
   - Refresh UI references in `docs/ui` and generate any new wireframes needed for upcoming work.
   - Draft requirement updates (SRS, user stories, risk matrix).
3. **Implementation**
   - Execute feature work across Next.js routes, shared components, and Zustand stores.
   - Maintain strict TypeScript typing and Tailwind guidelines documented in `docs/dev/STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
   - Pair with design to validate states, focus outlines, and responsive behaviour.
4. **Verification**
   - Run linting, unit tests, and Playwright smoke suites locally and in CI.
   - Conduct exploratory testing using the QA checklist.
   - Document findings in the QA report and update bug tracking entries.
5. **Release preparation**
   - Draft release notes summarising new capabilities and migrations.
   - Update the public README and changelog as needed.
   - Confirm deployment readiness via `npm run build` and the deployment guide.
6. **Post-release monitoring**
   - Gather user feedback, review analytics (where available), and capture follow-up tasks.
   - Schedule maintenance activities and triage new issues.

## Milestones and timeline
| Milestone | Target date | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery wrap-up | Week 1 | Updated backlog, refreshed requirements, approved risk register |
| Design sign-off | Week 2 | Validated UI flows, updated system diagrams, reviewed data schema |
| Feature complete | Week 4 | All scoped functionality merged behind feature flags where needed |
| Verification complete | Week 5 | Passing automated test suites, QA sign-off, zero high-severity defects |
| Release | Week 6 | Production deployment, published release notes, updated docs |
| Post-release review | Week 7 | Retrospective notes, maintenance backlog, roadmap adjustments |

Timelines assume a six-week cycle with cross-functional availability. Adjustments are recorded in the roadmap and communicated via the weekly status update.

## Dependencies
- Stable access to design assets within `assets/` (diagrams, wireframes, references).
- Maintained CI pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`.
- Alignment with code review bandwidth from maintainers.
- Availability of product owner and design lead for sign-offs.

## Resource plan
- **Engineering** – 1 lead developer + 1–2 contributors per cycle focused on features and bug fixes.
- **Design** – 1 design lead for UI reviews, prototypes, and accessibility validation.
- **QA** – Shared responsibility across engineering contributors with documented checklists.
- **Documentation** – Maintainers and contributors updating relevant sections as features evolve.

## Change management
- Significant scope changes require approval from the product owner and technical lead.
- Update the backlog and roadmap to reflect new priorities; document rationale in meeting notes.
- Communicate changes through the weekly status call and asynchronous updates.

## Acceptance criteria
- Each milestone meets its deliverables with supporting documentation and sign-offs.
- No high-severity defects remain open at release time.
- Documentation and release notes reflect shipped functionality.
- Stakeholders confirm the release meets the objectives set out in the charter.
