## Customizing Subjects (Colors & Icons)

1. Open **Subjects** from the main navigation and choose **New Subject** or edit an existing one.
2. Pick an icon:
   - Use the search box to filter by category (science, math, language, history, technology, misc).
   - Click an icon tile to select it; the popover closes automatically.
3. Choose a color:
   - Select a preset swatch to apply one of the curated themes.
   - Or enter a custom HEX, RGB, or HSL value—valid inputs update the preview instantly.
4. Watch the live preview update with the subject name, icon, color token, and exam date.
5. Save to apply the identity to all topics in that subject.

### Tips

- If you enter an invalid color, an inline message will prompt you to adjust the format.
- Dark colours automatically switch preview text to a light variant for legibility.
- You can leave the exam date empty; the preview will show “Exam: Not set”.
