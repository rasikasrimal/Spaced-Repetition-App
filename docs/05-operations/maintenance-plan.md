| Bi-weekly | Run dependency updates, review Playwright snapshots, audit accessibility results. |
| Monthly | Review documentation for accuracy, update maintenance log, assess roadmap alignment. |
| Quarterly | Conduct configuration audit, rotate credentials, run performance benchmarks, hold retrospective. |
| Annually | Review licensing, evaluate long-term roadmap, archive outdated assets. |

- Archive the repository in read-only mode and update documentation to indicate status.
- Communicate plan to community channels and contributors.

## Review and approval
- Maintenance plan reviewed quarterly during retrospective.
- Updates require agreement from technical lead and product owner.
