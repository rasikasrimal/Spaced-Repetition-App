# Security & Privacy Notes

## Data handled

- **Subjects**: name, icon, colour, optional exam date.
- **Topics**: title, notes, intervals, reminder preferences, review history.
- **Review events**: timestamps and interval metadata for completed or skipped sessions.
- **Profile preferences**: name, email, role, avatar colour, timezone, and notification toggles.

All information is stored locally in the browser via `localStorage`; no data leaves the device by default.

## Privacy boundaries

- The application does not perform network requests for learner data. Clearing the browser storage removes all subjects, topics, and profile preferences.
- Exported timelines and screenshots generated by the learner inherit whatever information is visible on-screen; treat them as personal data when sharing.

## Destructive actions

- Deleting a subject requires the subject to be empty; otherwise the UI blocks the action and asks the learner to reassign topics first.
- Topic deletion, skip, and review adjustments surface confirmation dialogs explaining the impact on the schedule.
- Revise actions are idempotent per local day—blocked attempts show a tooltip instead of silently ignoring the request.

## Timezone spoofing considerations

- The learner can edit their timezone from `/settings`. Changing it immediately shifts the local-midnight boundary used for revise locks and relative labels.
- Because everything is client-side, a malicious user could override `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` or mutate `localStorage`. This only affects their own device; no server-side enforcement exists.
- When diagnosing schedule anomalies, confirm the timezone stored in `spaced-repetition-profile` matches the learner’s expectation and that the system clock is accurate.
