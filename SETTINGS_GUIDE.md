# Settings Guide

## Revision strategy

- **Mode toggle** – Choose between **Adaptive** (default) and **Fixed interval**. Adaptive mode applies the forgetting-curve scheduler globally. Fixed mode preserves the static interval lists you may have configured manually.
- **Retention trigger slider** – Available in adaptive mode. Range: 30–80%. The slider controls the retention percentage that will trigger the next review for every topic. Adjustments reschedule upcoming reviews immediately using the forgetting-curve model.
- **Live preview** – The right-hand panel charts the predicted decay from the last review to the trigger point and lists the next few checkpoints. Use it to validate how far the scheduler will push upcoming sessions.
- **Projected cadence list** – Displays the next four review dates computed for a sample topic. Dates respect subject exam caps.

Tip: lower triggers (~30–40%) favour more frequent refreshers; higher triggers (~70–80%) lengthen spacing to prioritise long-term retention.
