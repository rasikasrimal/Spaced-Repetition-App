# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in helping improve the Spaced Repetition App! This document outlines how to get started, how we review changes, and the standards we hold for contributions.

## Getting Set Up

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Execute `npm run lint` and `npm run test:visual` before submitting a pull request to catch issues early.

## Branching and Commits

- Create feature branches from `main` using a descriptive name (for example, `feature/timeline-zoom`).
- Keep commits focused and write clear commit messages explaining the intent of each change.
- Rebase onto the latest `main` before opening a pull request to avoid merge conflicts.

## Pull Requests

- Describe the change, motivation, and testing in the pull request template.
- Reference any related issues and include screenshots or screen recordings when UI changes are made.
- Ensure the pull request remains scoped to a single feature or fix. Open multiple PRs for unrelated changes.

## Code Style

- Write TypeScript using strict typing and prefer existing utility helpers where available.
- Keep components small and composable; colocate unit tests alongside the code they cover.
- Follow Tailwind conventions already established in the codebase and use design tokens defined in `tailwind.config.ts`.

## Documentation

- Update relevant docs in `docs/` and the README when behaviour or configuration changes.
- Provide release notes or migration guidance if the change alters user-facing workflows.

## Communication

If you have questions, open a GitHub Discussion or start a draft PR for early feedback. For sensitive issues, contact the maintainers at `security@spacedrepetition.app`.

We appreciate every contributionâ€”thank you for helping build a better study companion!
