# Project Description

The Spaced Repetition App is a local-first study companion that helps learners capture topics, organise them by subject, and revisit material at the right time. Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand, the app keeps data in the browser so revision sessions remain private and fast. A dual light/dark theme—implemented with hard-coded palettes instead of design tokens—keeps the interface predictable across devices.

Key capabilities include:

- Subject-centric dashboards that keep colours, icons, and exam dates consistent everywhere.
- Topic editors with spaced-review scheduling, manual history backfill, and daily review limits.
- Calendar, timeline, and analytics views that visualise upcoming workload and exams with inline topic labelling.
- Reviews, subjects, and navigation cues tuned for high-contrast light mode so urgent states stay legible without shadows.
- A resilient offline-first architecture with predictable deployments and end-to-end UI tests.
- A flat, shadow-free interface with a persistent theme toggle for accessibility and focus clarity.

For quick-start instructions, testing notes, and architectural background, see the [README](README.md) and the `docs/` directory.
