# Project Description

The Spaced Repetition App is a local-first study companion that helps learners capture topics, organise them by subject, and revisit material at the right time. Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand, the app keeps data in the browser so revision sessions remain private and fast.

Key capabilities include:

- Subject-centric dashboards that keep colours, icons, and exam dates consistent everywhere.
- Topic editors with spaced-review scheduling, manual history backfill, and daily review limits.
- Calendar, timeline, and analytics views that visualise upcoming workload and exams.
- A resilient offline-first architecture with predictable deployments and end-to-end UI tests.

For quick-start instructions, testing notes, and architectural background, see the [README](README.md) and the `docs/` directory.
